# Coverity Cloud Terraform Automation

This repository provides the example terraform scripts to create the required infrastructure for Coverity Cloud deployment

# Overview

Synopsys has created these example terraform scripts to provide customers a template to use when building out infrastructure for Coverity Cloud Deployments. While these scripts do work out of the box and can be used to create a test infrastructure, they are not expected to be used as-is in a production setting and are **provided without support**.

Currently, the supported cloud providers are:
- [AWS](./aws)
- [GCP](./gcp)
- [AZURE](./azure)


In addition, we provide a [pure-kubernetes reference implementation](./kubernetes).
